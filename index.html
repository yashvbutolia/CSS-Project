       <li>CSS describes how HTML element are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in the other media.</li>
       <li><span class="strike"> CSS is not ncessary </span><span class="colored">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
       <li><u class="italic">Exernal stylesheets are stored in CSS files</u></li>
    </ol>

   <h2 class="italic red">CSS can be added to HTML documents in ways:</h2> 

   <ul>
       <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
       <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
       <li>External - by using a link element to an external CSS file</li>
       <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in the external CSS files. However, <span class="colored">in this tutorials we will use inline and internal CSS styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
   </ul>

   <p class="brown">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements, ID, on the other hand applies a style to a unique element. ID is also special in that in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>

   <p class="brown">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element on a web page. once an element has been targeted, a style or a set of styles can be applied to the element</p>

   <p class="brown">There is wide range of selectors available, Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
